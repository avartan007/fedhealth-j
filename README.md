# FedHealth-J: Federated Learning for Japanese Elderly Health Monitoring

**Privacy-Preserving, Culturally-Aware Anomaly Detection on Edge Devices**  

---

## Overview
**FedHealth-J** is a lightweight, federated learning-based system for detecting health anomalies (e.g., irregular heart rate, prolonged inactivity) in elderly Japanese users â€” **without compromising privacy**.  

Key features:
- Federated Learning (no raw data leaves device)  
- Cultural & Seasonal Adaptation (Japanese lifestyle)  
- Edge Optimized (runs on smartphones/Raspberry Pi)  
- Open-source + reproducible
